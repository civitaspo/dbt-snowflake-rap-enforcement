# Releasing

This repository uses a tagpr-equivalent release flow built on CSM actions and [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/).

## Overview

1. Commits land on `main` via squash-merged pull requests.
2. The **Release PR** workflow runs git-cliff to bump the version and regenerate `CHANGELOG.md`, then asks `civitaspo/securefix-server` to open or update `release/next`.
3. The **Release PR Sync** workflow updates the open `release/next` pull request title and body from `.release-version` (securefix creates the PR once and does not refresh metadata on later pushes).
4. A human squash-merges `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`.
5. The **Release Tag** workflow creates an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` and requests a server-side release.
6. The securefix-server **Release dbt Snowflake RAP** workflow checks out the tag and publishes the GitHub Release.

## Repository release protections

- **Tag protection** (`Protect tags` ruleset): active — blocks force-pushes and deletion of tags outside the allowed release path.
- **Immutable releases**: enabled when the publisher creates a draft release, attaches notes, then publishes once.

## Version bump rules (while major is 0)

Configured in `cliff.toml` (`[bump]`) and applied by git-cliff:

- Conventional Commit breaking change (`type!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE`) → minor
- `feat:` → minor
- everything else releasable → patch
- Only `chore(release):` commits since the last tag → nothing to release

The Release PR workflow floors the base version on both the latest `v*` tag and `.release-version` on `main`. If the floor tag is not present yet (release merged, Release Tag still running), it creates a **local** tag at the matching `chore(release):` commit so git-cliff does not re-propose the version that just shipped. That local tag is never pushed.

## Local preview

```bash
mise install --locked
mise exec -- git cliff --bumped-version
mise exec -- git cliff --tag vX.Y.Z --output CHANGELOG.md
```

git-cliff regenerates the full changelog from git history. Prefer Conventional Commit subjects over hand-edited `## Unreleased` notes that would be overwritten on the next Release PR prepare.

## Server request format

The Release Tag workflow creates a label on `civitaspo/securefix-server` whose description is:

```text
civitaspo/dbt-snowflake-rap-enforcement/<run_id>/vX.Y.Z/<merge-commit-sha>
```

If that string would exceed GitHub's 100-character label description limit, the merge commit SHA is omitted and the server resolves it from the merged `release/next` pull request.

The merge commit SHA is preferred because `Release Tag` on a merged `release/next` PR tags the squash-merge commit on `main`, while the workflow run's `head_sha` is the PR head.

See [securefix.md](securefix.md) for client/server credential layout.
